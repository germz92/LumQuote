# Quotes Management Page - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Converted the "Load Quotes" modal into a full-page quotes management system with advanced filtering, search, sorting, and archive functionality.

## New Features

### 1. **Full Page Quotes Management** (`/quotes`)
- Dedicated page for viewing and managing all saved quotes
- Clean, card-based layout with all quote information visible
- Responsive grid design that adapts to screen size

### 2. **Sticky Search & Filter Controls**
The header stays at the top while scrolling, containing:
- **Search bar**: Search by quote name, client name, or location
- **Sort dropdown**: 
  - Newest First
  - Oldest First
  - Name (A-Z)
  - Name (Z-A)
- **Date filter**: Filter quotes that have services on a specific date
- **Clear filters button**: Appears when filters are active

### 3. **Archive Functionality**
- Archive/Unarchive quotes with dedicated buttons
- Archived quotes:
  - Do NOT appear in the calendar view
  - Do NOT appear in active quotes by default
  - Can be viewed by clicking "View Archived" toggle button
  - Visually distinct with grayed-out styling and "ARCHIVED" badge

### 4. **Quote Cards Display**
Each quote card shows:
- Quote title with total price
- Client name
- Location (if set)
- Service date range (if dates are assigned)
- Number of services and days
- Last updated date
- Action buttons: Load Quote, Archive/Unarchive, Delete

### 5. **Quick Actions**
- **Load Quote**: Immediately loads the quote and navigates to main page
- **Archive**: Archives quote (removes from calendar and active view)
- **Unarchive**: Restores quote to active status
- **Delete**: Permanently deletes quote with confirmation

## Database Schema Changes

### SavedQuote Schema
```javascript
{
  name: String (required, unique),
  quoteData: Object (required),
  clientName: String (optional),
  location: String (optional),
  archived: Boolean (default: false),  // NEW FIELD
  timestamps: true
}
```

## API Endpoints

### New Endpoint
- **POST /api/archive-quote/:name**
  - Body: `{ archived: boolean }`
  - Archives or unarchives a quote
  - Returns: `{ success: true, archived: boolean }`

### Modified Endpoints
- **GET /api/calendar-events**
  - Now filters out archived quotes (`archived: { $ne: true }`)
  - Ensures archived quotes don't appear on calendar

## User Flow

## Technical Details

### Date Filtering Logic
- Filters quotes that have at least one day with the selected date
- Handles both ISO date format and YYYY-MM-DD format
- Normalizes dates for accurate comparison

### Archive System
- Uses boolean flag in database (not separate collection)
- Maintains data integrity (no data loss)
- Reversible operation (can unarchive anytime)
- Calendar automatically excludes archived quotes

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid collapses to single column on mobile
- Filters stack vertically on small screens
- Touch-friendly button sizes

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Separate archived quotes from active work
2. **Cleaner Calendar**: Only show relevant, active quotes
3. **Full-Page Experience**: More space to view and manage quotes
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Find quotes quickly with multiple filter options
5. **Date-Based Search**: Find quotes by service date
6. **Persistent Sticky Header**: Always have access to search/filter controls
7. **Immediate Loading**: One-click quote loading without extra steps

## Backwards Compatibility

- Existing quotes without `archived` field default to `false` (active)
- All existing functionality preserved
- No breaking changes to existing features
- Old modal code removed cleanly

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test archiving and unarchiving quotes
2. Verify archived quotes don't appear on calendar
3. Test date filter with various quote configurations
4. Test search functionality with different query types
5. Verify quote loading works correctly
6. Test responsive layout on mobile devices
7. Verify all navigation links work correctly
